# Ridge Regression-Weather-forecasting
Data is sourced from https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/ which is the National Centers for Environmental Information

The model attempts to predict the maximum temperature for a given date using a ridge regression model

This script is still a work in progress, and the next steps for this model is to also predict minimum temperatures, and then plot the predicted values for both max and min

This script requires the following Python packages:
```
pandas
NumPy
matplotlib
statsmodels
scikit-learn
```
